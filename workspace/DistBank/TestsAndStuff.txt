In order to appropriately test all the cases, we have included a topology file that contains three branches layer out in this manner:

00->01
01->00
01->02

We also launch an account (GUI) with each branch above.
Account 00050 goes with branch 00
Account 00051 goes with branch 01
Account 00052 goes with branch 02

Therefore, branch 0 and 1 can communicate with each other. Branch 1 has a unidirectional link to branch 2, and branch 2 has no links with branch 0.
This topology layout covers all the possible cases of how the branches can be connected to each other. Either there is a uni-directional link both ways between the branches, or there is only one uni-directional link from one branch to another, or there are no links between two branches at all.

The following interactions through the gui will thouroughly the cases covered in the topology above:
GENERAL TESTS to perform no matter from what account:
   - Test any action on a branch with the wrong account. For example, text branch 00 with 00052 which has no connection links to 00. Will fail.
   - Test serial number field with a text input instead of a numeric input . Result is a rejection
   - Test the src account field with a text input instead of a numeric input. Result is a rejection
   - Test the src account field with an input that does not follow the bb.aaaaa format. Result is rejection
   - Test the dest account field with a text input instead of numeric input. Result is a rejection
   - Test the dest account field with an input that does not follow the bb.aaaaa format. Result is rejection
   - Test the amount field with a negative number. Result is rejection
   - Test the amount field with a non-numeric entry. Result is a rejection.
Test deposit:
    - Deposit 10$ into this account at branch 00 with serial number 0
    - Try to perform another action (deposit,withdraw, check balance) with same serial number 0. This should be rejected.
Test withdraw:
    - Withdraw 5$ from this account with serial number 1. 
Test check balance:
    - Check balance of this account with serial number 2. Should return $5.
Test transfer:
 (1) Testing transfer between two branches that can communicate with each other.
    - Since we know that there exist a uni-directional connection both ways between branch 00 and branch 01, that means 00.00050 and 01.00051 can make transfers between each other. So
	- Either on branch 00 or branch 01, using a different serial number, make a transfer of some amount from src account being either 00.00050 or 01.00051 to the destination account 01.00051 or 00.00050. On success of the transaction, go to the other branch to make sure it received the transfer by checking the balance on that account.
		- attempt doing a transfer with a previously used serial number. Will fail.
(2) Testing transfer between a branch that has a uni-directional link to another branch.
	- In this example, we know 01 can communicate with 02, but 02 can not communicate with 01. Therefore, if we try to transfer from 01 to 02, it should withdraw from our account, and should deposit into the account at 02, but we will never get a response.

(3) Testing a transfer when there is no link.
	If 00 tries to transfer to 02, the transfer should fail as no link exists between 00 and 02. However, the withdraw from 00 will occur. So we should observe that change.
	- Make a transfer from 00 to 02. Money should be withdrawn from the account at 00, but should not be deposited into 02. An error will come up.
