- separate configuration from appmanager (not necessary)
	- drop down box on oracle for nodes

- write new assumption for serial numbers during transfer

	- make sure all requests get response or else no replication and no guarantees??
	- if no backup nodes, fail client??

- on receive of synch from new primary, should we fail any previous primaries?

- do we synch to ourselves during a synch (even if we are primary?)

- on receive of a new message, we assume we are primary; do we fail old primaries?
